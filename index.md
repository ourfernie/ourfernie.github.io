## OurFernie has closed

OurFernie's time has come, and we've decided to shutdown the site.  This has been
a long time coming as we were not able to spend time maintaining it or contributing
content.

A big thank you to all of our past users and contributors, and to
[Claris Media](https://clarismedia.com) for provising hosting for the last couple
of years.

### Contact
