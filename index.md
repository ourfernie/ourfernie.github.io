## OurFernie has closed

OurFernie's time has come and we've decided to shutdown the site.  This has been
a long time coming as we were not able to spend time on maintainance or contributing
content.

A big thank you to all of our past users and contributors, and to
[Claris Media/Fernie Fix](http://ferniefix.com) for providing hosting.
